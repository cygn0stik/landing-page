# landing-page
In this Odin project I will be creating an entire web page with 4 main sections (including footer). The main goal is to get my project as close as I can to the design that TOP provided on their website but I will also be experimenting with my own color palette and fonts.

## progress
My web page is mostly finished(altough it looks quite bad on mobile), I have to add flex wrap in a few places to create a responsive layout
