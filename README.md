# landing-page
In this Odin project I will be creating an entire web page with 4 main sections (including footer). The main goal is to get my project as close as I can to the design that TOP provided on their website but I will also be experimenting with my own color palette and fonts. 

## 1. Header with navbar and hero content

## 2. Four images with description

## 3. Quote or a longer paragraph

## 4. Newsletter signup form
