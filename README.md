# landing-page
In this Odin project I will be creating an entire web page with 4 main sections (including footer). The main goal is to get my project as close as I can to the design that TOP provided on their website but I will also be experimenting with my own color palette and fonts. 

## 1.
Header with a navbar as well as the slogan and an image underneath

## 2.
Content with 4 images with rounded corners and description

## 3.
Quote or a longer paragraph

## 4.
Newsletter signup form
